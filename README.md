### Solving LeetCode problems and other alogorithms in Scala way
* Two Sum Problem ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/TwoSum.scala))
* Add Two Numbers ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/TwoNumbers.scala)): Input type changed to scala's List type because the input leetcode provided is created with null, and that is considered not good practice.
* Longest Substring without Repeating Characters ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChars.scala))
* Reverse Integer ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/ReverseInteger.scala))
* ThreeSum ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/ThreeSum.scala))
* Container with Most Water ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/ContainerWithMostWater.scala))
* Longest Palindromic Substring ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/LongestPalindromicSubstring.scala))
* Median of Two Sorted Arrays ([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) / [Solution](src/main/scala/leetcode/FindMedianSortedArrays.scala))
